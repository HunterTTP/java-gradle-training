### Notes
* Statement - a complete command to be executed. It can include one or more expressions.
* Expression - a part of a statement that evaluates to a single value (eg 1+2)
* Types - a kind of value that is stored in a variable (int, float, string, etc). This changes how memory is allocated to the variable.
* Class - a blueprint for creating objects and defining their behavior
* Wrapper class - commonly used by data types (int, float, string, etc) which allows them to be an object and use optional functions
* Overflow - when too large or too small of a value is entered into a variable (also called wraparound)
* Casting - converting (or treating) one type of variable like another
* Operators - symbols that perform specific operations (+, *, ^, etc) (= is the assignment operator)
* Operands - items being acted upon by an operator (e.g. 12 + 15, 12 and 15 are the operands)
* Naming conventions:
    * Project Name - FirstJavaProject
    * Class - NewClass
    * Method - getData
    * Variable - firstVariable
* Method - a collection of statements that perform a function
* Main Methods - serves as an entry/starting point for the app
* Code blocks - grouping of statements and/or methods
